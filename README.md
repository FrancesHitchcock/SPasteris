## Context
This is a real academic website published on the University College London domain, and produced on a voluntary basis.

## Objectives
The objective was to produce an academic website for an individual, to include personal and academic information, links to academic papers, other academic websites and university websites. 

## Specification
Instructions were for the webpage to include:

* A home page, a qualifications page, a research page and a publications page.
* A photograph on each page to represent the content of the page.
* Links to relevant universities, links to academic papers, links to colleagues' web pages or LinkedIn pages.
* Brief explanations of a number of research areas.
* Contact details.
* The client was keen for the links to be subtle, so as not to detract from the overall style of the website.

## Response
* An essentially monochrome design was agreed, with one additional colour. A simple layout was adopted as the website's main function was to provide information and links to academic papers.
* Styles for links were subtle as requested. A compromise was agreed in the case of mobile device screens so as to improve clarity and usability.
